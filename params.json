{"name":"Create RESTFul WebServices using Jersey, Jackson and Spring","tagline":"by Nirav Shah","body":"### Welcome to JerseySpringExample!\r\n===================\r\nThis project demonstrates the simple implementation of provisioning your **REST** based Web Service infrastructure using the best breeds of libraries.\r\n\r\n### What's Included\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n 1. **[Jersey](https://jersey.java.net/)** - The reference implementation of the JAX-RS from Oracle.\r\n    Provides a very rich, and robust API for implementing RESTful\r\n    Services, including a client Library\r\n 2. Utilize the [**Faster-XML**](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) and [**Hibernate object mapper**](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-datatype-hibernate) to remove the  **[JSON circular dependencies issue](https://github.com/niravrshah/JerseySpringExample/blob/master/src/main/java/com/shah/java/reference/service/ws/client/ReferenceEntityServiceClient.java)**\r\n 3. Demonstrate different reference examples regarding building different CRUD based entity service (*[BaseService](https://github.com/niravrshah/JerseySpringExample/blob/master/src/main/java/com/shah/java/service/ws/BaseService.java)*, *[BaseCrudEntityService](https://github.com/niravrshah/JerseySpringExample/blob/master/src/main/java/com/shah/java/service/ws/entity/BaseCrudEntityService.java)* etc..)\r\n 4. **[Jersey Client utility](https://github.com/niravrshah/JerseySpringExample/blob/master/src/main/java/com/shah/java/util/JerseyUtil.java)** with [sample code](https://github.com/niravrshah/JerseySpringExample/blob/master/src/main/java/com/shah/java/reference/service/ws/client/ReferenceEntityServiceClient.java) which could help to **make a system to system call to REST resources**\r\n 4. Provide **Jersey Jackson + Spring integration**\r\n 5. Demonstrate an example to build the **REST based CRUD services**\r\n 7. **Web Service Discovery** using **[WADL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language)** implementation\r\n\r\n###How to Build?\r\nWe are using maven to build and manage the project dependencies. To build the project, go to the project work directory and execute below maven goal \r\n>***mvn clean install***\r\n \r\n###Handy URIs after deployment. You could check the currently deployed version to EC2 by clicking on them below.\r\nBelow sample URIs will be helpful to you to navigate some of the REST based service comes free with this project and ready to use after building and deploying the project. [Currently deployed in EC2]\r\n\r\n 1. **[WADL](http://ec2-52-8-210-14.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/JerseySpringExample/)**\r\n 2. **[Get All Sources](http://ec2-52-8-210-14.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/JerseySpringExample/rest/referenceservice/sources/)**\t\r\n 3. [**Get Source ID by Source name**](http://ec2-52-8-210-14.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/JerseySpringExample/rest/referenceservice/sources/sourcename/Spring)\r\n 4. **[Get Source name by Source ID](http://ec2-52-8-210-14.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/JerseySpringExample/rest/referenceservice/sources/4)**\r\n 5. [**Update payment**](http://ec2-52-8-210-14.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/JerseySpringExample/rest/payment/save)\r\n 6. Persist **[parent/child cascading](http://ec2-52-8-193-203.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/JerseySpringExample/rest/reference/entityservice/client/save/parent)** through ***SOAP-UI/rest client ONLY***(also remove JSON circular\r\n    dependencies)\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"line-height: 1.2; font-size: 13px;\">Authors and Contributors</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Nirav R Shah (<a href=\"http://github.com/niravrshah\">@niravrshah</a>)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Support or Contact</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Having trouble/questions&nbsp;with the project? <a href=\"mailto:niravkumar.r.shah@gmail.com?subject=Need%20Support%20for%20SampleWebDemo\">Contact support</a> and we&rsquo;ll help you sort it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<footer class=\"site-footer\"><span class=\"site-footer-owner\"><a href=\"https://github.com/niravrshah/SampleWebDemo\">Samplewebdemo</a> is maintained by <a href=\"https://github.com/niravrshah\">niravrshah</a>.</span></footer>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
