Welcome to JerseySpringExample!
===================

This project demonstrate the simple implementation of provisioning your **REST** based Web Service infrastructure using the best breeds of libraries.

What's Included
-------------

 1. **Jersey** - The reference implementation of the JAX-RS from Oracle.
    Provides a very rich, and robust API for implementing RESTful
    Services, including a client Library
 2. **Jackson FasterXML - JSON** - the high-performance JSON processor
 3. Utilize the [Faster-XML](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) and [Hibernate object mapper](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-datatype-hibernate) to remove the  **JSON circular dependencies issue**
 4. Demonstrate different reference example to show how to post and
    consume different rest based services
 5. **[Jersey Client utility](https://github.com/niravrshah/JerseySpringExample/blob/master/src/main/java/com/shah/java/util/JerseyUtil.java)** with sample code which could help to **make a system to system call to REST resources**
 6. Demonstrate the example to build the **REST based CRUD services**
